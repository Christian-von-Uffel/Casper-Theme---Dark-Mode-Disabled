# Casper-Theme---Dark-Mode-Disabled

Love blogging with Ghost and using their Casper theme, but hate that dark mode's enabled by default?

Download Casper 3.0.12 with dark mode disabled or download the source files in the repo and compress them yourself.

## What changes were made to the Casper theme to disable dark mode?

Disabling dark mode requires changing /assets/built/screen.css and the /assets/css/screen.css to disable code by deleting or commenting out dark mode CSS styles.
