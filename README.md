# Disable Dark-Mode

Love blogging with Ghost, but hate the dark mode preferences that are enabled on their themes by default?

Download Ghost's blog themes with dark mode settings disabled.

Download themes individual ZIP files or download source files and compress them yourself.

## What changes are made to themes to disable dark mode?

Disabling dark mode requires changing /assets/built/screen.css and /assets/css/screen.css to disable code by commenting out dark mode CSS styles.
